# Dock

As Docking controls are often asked by community, we decided to make a theme for the [Dock](https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Dock) library. 

![dock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef7ec55f-f13c-4214-b5ce-ad5ef3042868)

## Install SukiUI.Dock Nuget Package

![{F7E52AB9-7A5A-4007-9CBC-8258079C1F78}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fac741b-55da-41f8-90cf-bd47809f8e9f)

## Reference it in your App.axaml

```xml
<StyleInclude Source="avares://SukiUI.Dock/Index.axaml" />
```

You can now install and use the Dock library with SukiUI !
